# DocTree Focus

[中文版](./README_zh_CN.md)

A SiYuan plugin that allows you to focus on a specific document and its children in the document tree, hiding all other documents for a cleaner workspace.

## Features

- **Focus Mode**: Right-click on any document in the file tree to focus on it and its children, hiding all other documents
- **Persistent Focus**: Focus state is saved between sessions, so your focus will be maintained after restarting SiYuan
- **Easy Exit**: A convenient exit button is added to the document tree toolbar for quickly returning to the full tree view
